# @companion-module/host

This package provides the host-side API that wraps the modules written with the `@companion-module/base` API with additional logic that runs in-process. It is designed to support multiple versions of the base API and provide a uniform interface back to the host application.

## Installation

npm install @companion-module/host
```
